# Saas Company Landing Page

- A professional looking website where I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the hamburguer menu and the FAQ accordion.

- This project is from the iCodeThis challenge website and does not use any frameworks or libraries. I have also used Brad Traversy's youtube video while doing this project.
